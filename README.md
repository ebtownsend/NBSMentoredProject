# Mentored Project - HR Application
## Why are we doing this project?
To apply all the learning from out 4 weeks of training into one project.

## How I expetced the challenge to go?
I expected the challenge to be tough, but doable as long as I remembered everything we had covered in our training and looked back over my notes.

## What went well?
I was able to utilise the project brief to get a clear sense of required functionality for the project. I then planned out the requirements and desired functionality in order to use my time effectively and complete the project in good time, alongside other work commitment while in my business area. This meant I had a clear plan of what functionality I needed to implement, a clear layout for structure of the page, and a list of intended styling points. 

## What didn't go as planned?
I struggled with implementing the 'Edit' functionality, as I was unsure of a way to edit an existing record as it is, instead of deleting it and creating a new one. I asked for adivce from my TDP buddy and found great resources online that helped me solve the problem. 

## Possible Improvements for future revisions of project
None.
